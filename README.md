# MontyHallGame
For problem set 2, I created a single activity Android app to simulate The Monty Hall Problem. The Monty Hall Problem is a classic probability teaser, sometimes considered a paradox. 
For problem set 3, I converted that app to use a fragment based approach instead of a single activity.
